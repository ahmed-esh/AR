# AR Website using Python

This project demonstrates how to integrate Augmented Reality (AR) into a website using Python, leveraging JavaScript libraries and frameworks. The main goal is to detect an image or marker and display interactive AR content on a web browser.

## Features

- Image detection for augmented content display
- Customizable AR markers
- Web-based AR experience, accessible through a browser
- Python-based backend integration
- Use of **JS.AR** for AR implementation

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: For backend handling and AR image processing.
- **JavaScript**: For front-end interactivity and integration with AR libraries.
- **JS.AR**: The AR library used for handling the augmented reality aspects on the website.
- **HTML/CSS**: For structuring and styling the website.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ahmed-esh/AR-website-Python.git
   cd AR-website-Python
   ```

2. **Install Python dependencies**:
   Make sure you have Python installed. You can create a virtual environment and install the dependencies by running:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/MacOS
   venv\Scripts\activate  # For Windows
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Start the local server**:
   To run the project locally, you can use Flask or another web server for hosting the Python backend:
   ```bash
   flask run
   ```
   This will run the website on `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

4. **Access the website**:
   Open your web browser and navigate to the above address.

## Usage

1. Navigate to the website in your browser.
2. Hold the AR marker in front of the camera (if available).
3. The AR content will appear when the marker is detected.

## Future Enhancements

- Add support for more complex AR objects.
- Implement AR experiences with multiple markers.
- Optimize the project for mobile devices.
